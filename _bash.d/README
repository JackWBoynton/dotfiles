# This directory (~/.bash.d) is a good place to put any bash customizations
# you'd like to make. Just create a file in this directory and it'll be sourced
# by ~/.bashrc.
#
# Only put bash-specific customizations here. Most things can probably be
# re-used between zsh and bash and those should be placed in the ../_common.sh
# dir instead.
